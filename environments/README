The environment.yaml file in this directory is the blueprint to a conda environment
This helps to keep results reproducible and simplifies setup on new machines so that you can focus the programming and not the setup.

To create the environment first copy the environment.yaml to a file named my_environment.yaml. Change the PYTHONPATH and CODON_PATH variables to point to the root directory of the repository within the my_environment.yaml file. This helps to ensure that importing modules works correctly and consistently. 


Next, install some version of conda (miniconda is recommended) following the UNIX based instructions @ https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html and then run the following command:

conda env create -f /path/to/my_environment.yaml

This will create a conda environment named codon_bioinf_env.
